SQL injection is a code injection technique that exploits a security vulnerability in a website's software. The vulnerability is present when user input is either incorrectly filtered for string literal escape characters embedded in SQL statements or user input is not strongly typed and unexpectedly executed. This can trick the software into executing unintended actions or accessing data without proper authorization.
